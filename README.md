zshguide
========

I don't own this, nor did I write it. All rights are for Peter Stephenson and
the original content can be found [here](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/zshguide.html).

This is simply a conversion from the original for markdown, split in several
files.

I think this makes it easier to go through and collaborate.
